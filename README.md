## Key Technologies

-   **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/):** Scalable PHP framework.
-   **[Livewire](https://livewire.com/):** Real-time web development.
-   **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Utility-first CSS for rapid design.

-   **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/):** Lightweight, serverless database.

## Quick Start Guide (for Windows)

Getting started with Fido is designed to be as simple as possible. Just follow these two steps:

1.  **Download the Project:**
    -   Download the project files as a ZIP and extract them to a folder on your computer.
    -   Alternatively, if you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/anas1412/Fido.git
        cd Fido
        ```

2.  **Run the Server:**
    -   Double-click the `server.bat` file.

That's it! The script will automatically handle everything for you:
-   It will download and set up the correct version of PHP if you don't have it.
-   It will download and configure Composer (the PHP package manager).
-   It will install all necessary dependencies.
-   It will create and set up the database.
-   It will start the application server and open it in your web browser.

## Default Admin Account

The application is pre-configured with a default administrator account. The credentials for this account are stored in the `.env` file in the project's root directory. You can edit this file to change the email and password.

-   **Email:** `admin@example.com`
-   **Password:** `password`

When you first run the `server.bat` script, the admin credentials will be displayed in the terminal window for your convenience.
