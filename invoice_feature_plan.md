# Plan for Client Invoice Management Feature

This document outlines the plan to add a client invoice management feature to the Fido application.

## 1. Feature Overview

The goal is to create a new section for managing invoices. This will allow the primary user (an accountant) to create, view, edit, delete, and download invoices on behalf of their clients.

## 2. Database Schema Changes

Two new tables will be created in the database:

### `invoices` table

This table will store the main invoice information.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `bigint`, unsigned, auto-increment | Primary key |
| `client_id` | `bigint`, unsigned | Foreign key to the `clients` table |
| `client_name` | `varchar` | The name of the client's client |
| `client_mf` | `varchar` | The tax ID of the client's client |
| `invoice_number` | `varchar` | Unique, sequential invoice number (e.g., `INV-2025-001`) |
| `date` | `date` | The date of the invoice |
| `total_hors_taxe` | `decimal` | Total amount before tax |
| `tva` | `decimal` | VAT amount |
| `montant_ttc` | `decimal` | Total amount after tax (`total_hors_taxe` + `tva`) |
| `timbre_fiscal` | `decimal` | Fiscal stamp amount |
| `net_a_payer` | `decimal` | Net amount to be paid (`montant_ttc` + `timbre_fiscal`) |
| `status` | `varchar` | The status of the invoice (e.g., `draft`, `sent`, `paid`, `overdue`) |
| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp` | Timestamp of last update |

### `invoice_items` table

This table will store the individual line items for each invoice.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `bigint`, unsigned, auto-increment | Primary key |
| `invoice_id` | `bigint`, unsigned | Foreign key to the `invoices` table |
| `object` | `varchar` | Description of the line item |
| `quantity` | `int` | The quantity of the item |
| `single_price` | `decimal` | The price per unit |
| `total_price` | `decimal` | The total for the line item (`quantity` * `single_price`) |
| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Timestamp of creation |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp` | Timestamp of last update |

## 3. Model Creation

Two new Eloquent models will be created:

- **`Invoice.php`**: This model will correspond to the `invoices` table.
- **`InvoiceItem.php`**: This model will correspond to the `invoice_items` table.

### Relationships

- The `Invoice` model will have a `hasMany` relationship with the `InvoiceItem` model.
- The `Invoice` model will have a `belongsTo` relationship with the `Client` model.
- The `Client` model will have a `hasMany` relationship with the `Invoice` model.

## 4. Filament Resource

A new Filament resource named `InvoiceResource` will be created.

### Form

The form for creating and editing invoices will include:

- A `Select` field to choose the client.
- A `TextInput` for the invoice number (which will be auto-generated and disabled).
- `DatePicker` fields for the issue date and due date.
- A `Repeater` field for adding/editing invoice items. The repeater will contain fields for the description, quantity, and unit price.
- A `Select` field for the invoice status.

### Table

The table for listing invoices will have the following columns:

- Invoice Number
- Client Name
- Date
- Net to Pay
- Status

### Actions

The following actions will be available:

- **View:** View the details of an invoice.
- **Edit:** Edit an existing invoice.
- **Delete:** Delete an invoice.
- **Download PDF:** Download the invoice as a PDF file.

## 5. PDF Generation

A new Blade view will be created to format the invoice for PDF output. A new route will be created to handle the PDF download, which will use the `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` package to generate the PDF.

## 6. Sequential Invoice Numbering

A system will be implemented to generate sequential and unique invoice numbers. This will be similar to the existing system for "notes d'honoraire" and will ensure that each invoice has a unique, non-editable number (e.g., `INV-2025-001`).

## 7. Dashboard Integration (Optional)

If time permits, a new widget can be added to the Filament dashboard to display key metrics related to invoices, such as:

- Total amount invoiced

## 8. Client Resource Integration

To display a client's invoices on the "DÃ©tails du client" page, a new relation manager will be created and integrated with the `ClientResource`.

### `InvoicesRelationManager`

- A new `InvoicesRelationManager` class will be created.
- This relation manager will display a table of the client's invoices.
- The table will have columns for the invoice number, date, total amount, and status.
- It will have actions to create, view, edit, and delete invoices directly from the client's detail page.

### `ClientResource` Modifications

The `getRelations()` method in `app/Filament/Resources/ClientResource.php` will be updated to include the new `InvoicesRelationManager`.

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        HonorairesRelationManager::class,
        NoteDeDebitsRelationManager::class,
        InvoicesRelationManager::class, // Add this line
    ];
}
```
